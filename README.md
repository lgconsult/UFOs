# UFOs

## Overview
  We designed a webpage to search for UFO sitings.

![Design of Webpage](https://github.com/lgconsult/UFOs/blob/main/picture_banner.png)
  Our webpage includes an introductory article about UFOs, a title banner with background picture, and a database that organizes UFO sightings by date, city, state, country, shape, duration and comments. Our webpage also includes a filter element that allows users to filter by date, city, state, country, and shape of the UFO.

## Summary
One drawback for this design is that there is a separate filter for every category we want to sort by. In the future I would suggest nesting all search features into one text field so that the page looks less cluttered. I would also add a filter option so that viewers can select the category they want to search such as "date", "city", or "state" as a drop down.
